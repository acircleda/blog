This is an ongoing project to analyze data-related jobs posted on [HigherEdJobs](http://www.higheredjobs.com). These are jobs a typical ESM student would qualify. The jobs are analyzed in order to understand the skills and competencies that are in demand.

The project is currently focused on administrative-level jobs. Faculty job analyses will be forthcoming.

The project files can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/acircleda/Data-Jobs). The analyses, always under development, can be found [here](https://acircleda.github.io/Data-Jobs/).
