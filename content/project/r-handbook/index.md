The [R Software Handbook](https://bookdown.org/aschmi11/RESMHandbook/) was developed as part of a summer internship with [Dr. Jennifer Ann Morrow](https://epc.utk.edu/people/jennifer-ann-morrow-phd/). The goal was to create an introduction to `R` resource guide relevant to students in our evaluation, statistics, and measurement PhD program. It would also be relevant to anyone interested in learning R. Its topics include setup, important, data manipulation, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The examples use real survey data and take readers from import, to cleaning, to analysis.
