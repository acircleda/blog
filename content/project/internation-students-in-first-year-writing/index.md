Many   in   international   education   are   well   aware   of increased   international   student   mobility   trends   and internationalization efforts around the world. The United States  in  particular  has  been  home  to  over  one  million international students for the last few years. The push for internationalization has become a buzzword on American campuses.  It  is  within  this  context  that  Megan  Siczek seeks  to  put  a  face  to  what  is  often  only  discussed  in numbers.  In  her  dissertation-turned-book, *International Students in First-Year Writing: A Journey through Socio-Academic Space* (2018),   Siczek   describes   the   lived experiences of 10international students enrolled in a first-year writing (FYW) course at an American university.
