*Note: The following Tableau dashboard represents real data that has been altered to maintain confidentiality.*

The purpose of this dashboard is to understand performance on a language test across different courses, with each course (A-F) becoming increasingly more advanced. The dashboard allows users to view progress holistically as well as at the individual course level.
