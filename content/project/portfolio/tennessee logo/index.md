The following design is meant to showcase some of my experience with Adobe Illustrator. The image below was designed for a t-shirt marketing campaign at the [English Language Institute](http://eli.utk.edu/). It depicts the phrase “welcome” in numerous languages, arranged to make the state of Tennessee’s outline. It includes the university and department names in their respective [brand UTK typologies](http://brand.utk.edu/), as well as the phrase [#YouAreWelcomeHere](https://www.youarewelcomehereusa.org/), also in a brand font. The colors are also part of the UTK color pallette. This design was printed on smokey gray and Tennessee orange shirts.
