This project uses a survey of recently-graduated PhD students to collect their employment status and their conferences and publications as listed on their CVs at the time of graduation. Using a logistic regression model, this research will attempt to determine if their is a connection between the number of conferences and their employment outcomes (full-time employment vs unemployment).
