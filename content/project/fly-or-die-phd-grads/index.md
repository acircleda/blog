The "Fly or Die" project is a multi-survey research project that looks at the complex relationship between graduate student conference travel, employability, and the climate crisis.

**Survey One** focuses on doctoral student employment outcomes, conferences attendance, conference activities, conference types, and publications. Analyses are across disciplines and job industries.

**Survey Two** focuses on tenure-track faculty search comittees and their attitudes toward recently-graduated PhD students' conference attendance, conference activities, and publications.

The ulitmate goal of this research is to understand the ideal conference and publication record that can maximize employment outcomes while minimizing our carbon footprints.
