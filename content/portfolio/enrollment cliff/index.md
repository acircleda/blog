  The purpose of this dashboard is to understand and explore forecasted enrollments in Higher Education. These forecasts are based on the *Higher Education Demand Index* developed by Dr. Nathan Grawe and published in his book "Demographics and the Demand for Higher Education". The interactive allows you to get an overview of the forecasts as well as take a deeper, state-by-state dive into the data.
