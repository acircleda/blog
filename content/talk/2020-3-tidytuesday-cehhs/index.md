### Abstract

Communities of practice (CoPs) are groups of people who share a common interest and participate in activities that promote learning. Originally face-to-face, the internet has ushered in many new platforms for CoPs. Twitter hashtags act as virtual homes for many. The #TidyTuesday hashtag serves as a community for those interested in data science and visualization. It involves weekly visualization challenges utilizing public datasets and the R programming language. Users contribute graphics and code to share their work and also as opportunities to learn from one another. As the importance of data science grows, the #TidyTuesday CoP is a promising context for the exploration of learning in online communities and of how individuals develop capabilities regarding visualization and programming.

  The current research represents an exploratory project that examines one year of #TidyTuesday tweets through descriptive and content analyses. It examines who contributes, the content of their tweets, the makeup of their code, and how their code changes over time.
  
  This data yielded 4,148 tweets by 1,231 unique users, 27% of whom contributed more than twice. Mean contribution was nine tweets per user and 5% contributed consistently. Only six consistent contributors appear in the list of the top-25 most popular users (by likes/retweets), meaning consistency may not represent the quality or popularity of content.
  
  To understand the types of content users contribute, a small sample of tweets was qualitatively analyzed, finding 58% of tweets explained visualizations, 18% focused on findings in the datan, and 13% expressed emotion related to learning. An analysis of Github code contributions classified code into one of nine data science functions. The results showed that most code (41.19%) represented data wrangling, followed by visualization (33.88%). Analyses also indicated that over time individuals wrote longer, more complex code.
  
  This preliminary research has education-related implications for those involved in data science. It suggests visualization requires strong programming skills, especially data wrangling; participation in the CoP can lead to an increase in these skills. We will discuss future directions for this work in light of scholarship on informal and social media-based contexts for learning.
