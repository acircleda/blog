<p>I recently started using <a href="https://tags.hawksey.info/">TAGS</a> to start archiving Twitter posts with key search phrases for later exploration and possible research. One of my search phrases was the hashtag #flyingless. #flyingless typically is appended to posts related to reducing the carbon footprint associated with flying, often flying to and from conferences, but also flying in general.</p>
<p>By just scraping the past few days worth of data, I found a few interesting takeaways.</p>
<div id="policies-and-guides" class="section level1">
<h1>Policies and Guides</h1>
<p>Fundings organizations are taking the carbon footprint of their funds into account. This is from the UK, but maybe we will see similar things from NSF or NIH?</p>

<p>The University of Santa Barbara is also promoting smaller carbon footprints with their <a href="http://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/">Nearly Carbon-Neutral Conference Model Guide</a></p>

<div id="there-is-some-good-research-about-flyingless" class="section level1">
<h1>There is some good research about #flyingless</h1>
<p>I learned about <a href="https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/13949/1/Young%20et%20al%20Flights%20of%20Fantasy%202015.pdf"><em>Flights of fantasy: A reformulation of the flyers’ dilemma</em></a> by Young, M., Markham, F., Reis, A. C., &amp; Higham, J. E. (2015).</p>

<p>And this master’s thesis by Lisa Jacobson, <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1221346/FULLTEXT01.pdf"><em>Transforming air travel behavior

<div id="people-are-enjoying-flyingless" class="section level1">
<h1>People are enjoying #flyingless</h1>
<p>People are sharing their #flyingless routes and the joy of slow travel. These mostly seem to be from Europe, where they can take advantage of modern rail travel.</p>

<div id="tags-is-really-cool" class="section level1">
<h1>TAGS is really cool!</h1>
<p>The functionality is really great, as it now only scrapes Twitter from the present to the past 7 days, but you can also ask it to scrape every hour until a maximum amount of Tweets is reached (you set the maximum). It also auto-produces a cool interative dashboard you can play with to explore Twitter users and their tweets in the datset. <a href="https://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/?key=1CrSy6fhs9x9cadgMLjPJuzfh5C7c5G3_3AMVRiwd1EM&amp;gid=400689247"><em>Click here to check out the dashboard related to my #flyingless TAGS.</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what you can do with all this Twitter data, I highly recommend checking out the online book <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/"><em>Text Mining with R</em></a>. It’s actually incredibly easy and really fun!</p>
