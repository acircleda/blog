I am currently taking a multilevel modeling class in my PhD program. It is week 3-ish and I am learning a lot. The course is software-agnostic, meaning we can use any software we want (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R, HLM). The first assignment comes as a data set and Word document. I am working completely in R / R Markdown to generate both the data and model analyses and to complete the Word-based homework. Because I am working in an R -> Word workflow, I need to know what options I have for creating nice tables of my models.

So, I am taking a break from my first assignment to compare the default output of the most popular R model summary packages, look at some extended features, and make a cross-package comparison for my own future reference.

Let's begin!

## The Models

For this example, I am going to use Allison Horst's `palmerpenguins` package for the data and produce two simple and non-substantive multi-level models. I will use `lme4::lmer` and `lmerTest::lme4`, which produces p-values and a few different estimates. Note: I will not be interpreting these models.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

# unconditional model
model_0 <- lme4::lmer(body_mass_g ~ 1 + (1 | island), REML = F, data=penguins)

model_0_lmertest <- lmerTest::lmer(body_mass_g ~ 1 + (1 | island), REML = F, data=penguins)

model_1 <- lme4::lmer(body_mass_g ~ sex + (1 | island), REML = F, data=penguins)

model_1_lmertest <- lmerTest::lmer(body_mass_g ~ sex + (1 | island), REML = F, data=penguins)
```

## The Packages

The most popular packages that can take a model object and produce a neat table summary include `modelsummary`, `gtsummary`, `huxtable`, and `sjPlot`. I will generate default tables with each of these packages with the goal of being able to insert them into a Word document via `knitr`. I will try to keep customization to a minimum.

### `modelsummary`

[`modelsummary`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html) offers the `msummary` function and allows me to create side-by-side tables. This **will** work for `lme4` models, but **will not** work for `lmerTest` models unless you load the package `broom.mixed` first.

```{r}
modelsummary::msummary(list(
  "Null Model" = model_0, 
  "Model 1" = model_1))
```

Here, I have loaded `broom.mixed` and added a call for significance stars with `stars=T`.

```{r}
library(broom.mixed)
modelsummary::msummary(list(
  "Null Model" = model_0_lmertest, 
  "Model 1" = model_1_lmertest), stars = T)
```

#### Notes

  * `msummary` produces a decent side-by-side table in Word.
  * The default style looks like APA, which is something I would want.
  * However, it splits the fixed effects of intercept and sex up so that intercept is above the random effects and sex is below. 
  * Finally, the default width is a bit narrow, meaning additional customization is needed. It can easily be customized using `flextable`, which works well in Word. The following code coverts it to `flextable`:
  
`modelsummary::msummary(list("Null Model" = model_0, "Model 1" = model_1), output = 'flextable')`

## `gtsummary`

`gtsummary` is based on the `gt` package, which allows easy and advanced customization of tables in `R`.

I could not get `gtsummary` to make a table for my null model, `model_0`. It produced the error: `Error: must be a character vector, not a logical vector.`. However, it worked for `model_1` and `model_1_lmertest`. Here is the no frills default:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gtsummary::tbl_regression(model_1_lmertest)
```

That table is *clearly* not a good table. I did some googling, and found I had to add the following tidy function to produce a table with all estimates:

```{r}
gtsummary::tbl_regression(model_1_lmertest, tidy_fun = broom.mixed::tidy)
```

#### Notes

  * This table is created in `gt`, but as of right now, `gt` doesn't work with Word so it was automatically converted to a `kable` table.
  * You can do a lot of customization using `gt` and then convert it to `kable` or `flextable` (using `as_flex_table()`).
  * While adding confidence intervals are nice, the lack of fit statistics makes the default output inadequate. Looking through the `gtsummary` reference, I do not see a way to add these.
  * Side-by-side tables requires saving each table as an object and then using `tbl_merge`.
  
## `huxtable`

[`huxtable`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/huxtable/vignettes/huxtable.html) works with both `lme4` and `lmerTest`. It uses the `huxreg` function and can easily make side-by-side tables.

```{r}
huxtable::huxreg(list(
                 "Null Model" = model_0_lmertest, 
                 "Model 1" = model_1_lmertest))
```

#### Screenshot from Word

#### Notes

 * By default `huxreg` produces a nice side-by-side table.
 * The default *looks like* simple ASCII/Markdown table, **but** it knits to Word nicely without any need to make changes.
 * Output looks like `modelsummary::msummary` but lacks ICC values.
 * `huxtable` also separates fixed effects like `modelsummary`
 * Can be customized via `huxtable` or `flextable` via `as_flextable` - though I could not get this to work.
 
## `sjPlot`

[`sjPlot`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/) is a table and visualization package meant for a number of social science methods (linear models, generalized linear models, PCA, robust standard errors, etc.).

Below is the HTML table. This table can be styled with CSS.

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(model_0, model_1, 
                  dv.labels = c("Null Model", "Model 1"))
```

#### Screenshot from Word

**NONE**

#### Notes

  * It works with `lmerTest`. However, if you only use `lme4`, `sjPlot` automatically adds p-values. 
  * `sjPlot` creates a *very* nice table with random effects listed with their Greek values, $\sigma^2$ and $\tau$, plus ICC and $R^2$!
  * Unfortunately, it produces only an HTML table and this table cannot be automatically added to Word.
  * Styling the table for HTML requires CSS.
  * It cannot be converted to `flextable` or `kable`

## Final Thoughts

In a perfect world, we would be able to knit the `sjPlot` table to Word and be done with it. Unfortunately, this does not work for now. The best and easiest option would be using `modelsummary::msummary`. If you need p-values, use `lmertest` and `broom.mixed`, and be sure to call `stars = T` inside `msummary`. Then, make sure to also include `output = 'flextable'` to add more customization and allow your table to knit to Word.

The following example creates a simple function to automatically customize the table (useful if you will have multiple tables), and adds ICC and R2. I did not have time to organize the fixed and random effects, nor add the Greek symbols (ideally, in parentheses), but I think it's easy to see how well `modelsummary` and `flextable` work together for your multilevel models!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)

#table formatting function
flex <- function(data, title=NULL) {
  set_table_properties(data, layout = "autofit", width = 1) %>%
  fontsize(size=12, part="all") %>%
      set_caption(title, 
                  autonum = officer::run_autonum(seq_id = "tab", 
                                                 pre_label = "Table ", 
                                                 post_label = "\n", 
                                                 bkm = "anytable"))
}

#adding ICC and R2 - note you can also write a function with glance_custom
# https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/newmodels.html
mlm_added <- tribble(~term, ~"Null Model", ~"Model 1",
                     "ICC", 
                        performance::icc(model_0)$ICC_conditional, 
                        performance::icc(model_1)$ICC_conditional,
                     "pseudo R2",
          performance::r2(model_0)[["R2_conditional"]][["Conditional R2"]],
          performance::r2(model_1)[["R2_conditional"]][["Conditional R2"]])

#changing names of coefficients
cm <- c("sexmale"="Male",
        "sd__(Intercept)"="SD Intercept (τ00)",
        "sd__Observation" = "SD Observation (σ2)",
        "(Intercept)" = "Intercept")

#the final table
modelsummary::msummary(list("Null Model" = model_0, 
                            "Model 1" = model_1), 
                       output = 'flextable', 
                       add_rows = mlm_added,
                       coef_map = cm) %>%
  flex("Multilevel Model of Palmer Penguins")
  
```
