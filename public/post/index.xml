      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Google collects &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of data on us. If you have Google Maps, chances are your location is being tracked, too. Unless, of course, you have it disabled. But, if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised by the amount of location data (and its accuracy) contained in your Google Timeline. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Many worry about Google&amp;rsquo;s tracking&lt;/a&gt;, but for those of us who don&amp;rsquo;t, there is some potential fun we can have with our own data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; our carbon emissions. I say &lt;strong&gt;estimate&lt;/strong&gt; because it is not exact and it is likely very difficult to account for (or even remember) all of your trips, who was with you, and how to split your emissions. Was your flight full? How &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; was the train? How much of an Uber trip&amp;rsquo;s emissions count for you vs the driver?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are difficult questions, and the real answer is elusive. But, we can come close. Using Google Location data, We can get the date and time of travel, start and end location, the distance traveled, the place, and most importantly, the activity type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow along and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you what I did. It&amp;rsquo;s no doubt imperfect, but for a beginner&amp;rsquo;s effort, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;get-your-data&#34;&gt;Get Your Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://takeout.google.com/?pli=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt;, and first click &amp;ldquo;Deselect all&amp;rdquo; at the right. Then, scroll down to &amp;ldquo;Location History&amp;rdquo; and click on &amp;ldquo;Multiple Formats&amp;rdquo;. Choose JSON and click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;. Check the checkbox and scroll down to the bottom. Select &amp;ldquo;Next step&amp;rdquo;. Here you can export your data once or set a schedule. Click &amp;ldquo;create export&amp;rdquo;. Dependning on the amount of data, the export can take a few minutes (or &amp;ldquo;days&amp;rdquo; as Google claims). I got a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of data in about 3 minutes. Just refresh the page to check on the status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When its ready, download your zip file. Extract your zip file somewhere convenient. Drill into the extracted folder until you find &amp;ldquo;Semantic Location Data&amp;rdquo;. That is what we are after. This will contain a folder for each year and a JSON file for each month in that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;load-and-process&#34;&gt;Load and Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need at minimum the following packages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jsonlite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lubridate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;load-data&#34;&gt;Load Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can load your data like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;df &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;file location/file&amp;quot;, flatten=TRUE))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON comes as a list format. I have no clue how to work with lists. So, I flattened it out to a data frame. I know how to work with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to write a for-loop to process the file list and automatically load the data, but since I was only working with 12 files (2019), I just did it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jan2019 &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;2019/2019_JANUARY.json&amp;quot;, flatten = TRUE))
feb2019 &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;2019/2019_FEBRUARY.json&amp;quot;, flatten = TRUE))
mar2019 &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;2019/2019_MARCH.json&amp;quot;, flatten = TRUE))
april2019 &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;2019/2019_APRIL.json&amp;quot;, flatten = TRUE))
may2019 &amp;lt;- data.frame(fromJSON(&amp;quot;2019/2019_MAY.json&amp;quot;, flatten = TRUE))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-data&#34;&gt;Process Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would simply &lt;code&gt;rbind&lt;/code&gt; the data and work with a single large data set, but many files had different numbers of columns, making it difficult to use &lt;code&gt;rbind&lt;/code&gt;. Thankfully, the data sets had the same variable names, so I wrote a function to process the data, selecting the variables I wanted and making a few changes (see &lt;a href=&#34;#function&#34;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;become-familiar-with-the-variables&#34;&gt;Become Familiar with the Variables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before processing the data, you should become familiar with the column names and what you may want to focus on. There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of variables in the JSON file. There are variables for start and end location, path variables, distance, place name, accuracy estimates, etc. Here are the ones I was most interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.activitySegment.distance

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distance travelled in feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.activitySegment.activityType

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flying, walking, in a car, on a train, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.latitudeE7 and timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.longitudeE7

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.latitudeE7 and timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.longitudeE7

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ending location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.placeVisit.location.name

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the place I went to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timelineObjects.placeVisit.duration.startTimestampMs

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the start time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://shiring.github.io/maps/2016/12/30/Standortverlauf_post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shirin&amp;rsquo;s playgRound&lt;/a&gt;, I had some clues about what to process in R, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to convert long/late from IE7 to GPS (divide by &lt;code&gt;1e7&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to convert time from POSIX milliseconds to human readable time &lt;code&gt;as.POSIXct(as.numeric(time_variable)/1000, origin = &amp;quot;1970-01-01&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem I noticed was that many rows were offset, meaning data was split between two or three rows. For example, time might have been in row 1 and location, and activity were in the next row. Sometimes, it was three rows. I used &lt;code&gt;lead()&lt;/code&gt; to grab data from the next row, and &lt;code&gt;zoo::na.locf()&lt;/code&gt; to grab data from the last non-empty row when &lt;code&gt;lead()&lt;/code&gt; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do the trick. This is not a perfect solution and no doubt cause some minor innacurrcies, but for the most part, for such a large data set, it seemed to do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;function&#34;&gt;Select and Mutate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following function selects key variables and then mutates them, creating variables with human-readable names. It also converts the distance to miles and kilometers. You could take it a step further and then select only those variables, dropping the original JSON columns, but I decided to leave them in out of laziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function takes a data frame name as its only input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##process data function
json_process &amp;lt;- function(dfin){
  dfin %&amp;gt;% select(timelineObjects.activitySegment.distance,
                  timelineObjects.activitySegment.activityType,
                  timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.latitudeE7,
                  timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.longitudeE7,
                  timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.latitudeE7,
                  timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.longitudeE7,
                  timelineObjects.placeVisit.location.name,
                  timelineObjects.placeVisit.duration.startTimestampMs) %&amp;gt;%
    mutate(
      start_lat = timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.latitudeE7 / 1e7,
      star_long = timelineObjects.activitySegment.startLocation.longitudeE7 / 1e7,
      end_lat = timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.latitudeE7 / 1e7,
      end_long = timelineObjects.activitySegment.endLocation.longitudeE7 / 1e7,
      time = lead(as.POSIXct(as.numeric(timelineObjects.placeVisit.duration.startTimestampMs)/1000, origin = &amp;quot;1970-01-01&amp;quot;), 3L),
      year = year(time),
      month = ifelse(is.na(time), month(zoo::na.locf(time)), month(time)),
      activity = ifelse(is.na(timelineObjects.activitySegment.activityType), zoo::na.locf(timelineObjects.activitySegment.activityType), timelineObjects.activitySegment.activityType),
      place = lead(timelineObjects.placeVisit.location.name, 3L),
      miles = timelineObjects.activitySegment.distance/1609,
      km = timelineObjects.activitySegment.distance/1000)
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the function like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jan &amp;lt;- json_process(jan2019)
feb &amp;lt;- json_process(feb2019)
mar &amp;lt;- json_process(mar2019)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then combined the data frames:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data &amp;lt;- rbind(jan, feb, mar, april, may, june, july, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;analyze-and-visualize&#34;&gt;Analyze and Visualize&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you should check what activities are listed in your data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data %&amp;gt;% group_by(activity) %&amp;gt;% count
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities included FLYING, IN_FERRY, IN_BUS, IN_SUBWAY, etc. However, I focused on only two carbon-emitting activities in my data - those that I could easily account carbon emissions for - and created a small data frame to use for filtering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;carbon_activities &amp;lt;- data.frame(activity = c(&amp;quot;FLYING&amp;quot;,
                              &amp;quot;IN_PASSENGER_VEHICLE&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created a new data frame that dropped missing values, selected only flying and car activities, and then calculated emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;prep &amp;lt;- data %&amp;gt;% drop_na(activity) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(activity %in% carbon_activities$activity) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    emissions = ifelse(activity == &amp;quot;FLYING&amp;quot;, km*.18, km*.14)
  ) %&amp;gt;% drop_na(emissions)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I get the figures for emissions? Well, it turns out that calculating carbon emissions from flying is quite difficult. Here are some notes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICAO website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1: Estimation of the aircraft fuel burn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2: Calculation of the passengers&amp;rsquo; fuel burn based on a passenger/freight factor which is derived from RTK data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 3: Calculation of seats occupied (assumption: all aircraft are entirely configured with economic seats). Seat occupied = Total seats x Load Factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 4: CO2 emissions per passenger = (Passengers&amp;rsquo; fuel burn x 3.16) / Seat occupied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: for flights above 3000 km, CO2 emissions per passenger in premium cabin = 2 x CO2 emissions per passenger in economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v10-2017.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;methodology paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; has enough of this information, including numerous tables, to make these calculations. While I intend to make a better attempt at this in the future, using some suggestions from &lt;a href=&#34;https://sheilasaia.rbind.io/post/2019-04-19-carbon-cost-calcs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sheila Saia&lt;/a&gt; I just wanted a rough, liberal estimate of my emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/jardine09-carboninflights.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this paper from the Environmental Change Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which explained several different methods of calculation. The simplest is based on the World Resource Institute&amp;rsquo;s liberal estimate of 0.18 kgCO2/km. I chose this because it was simple to calculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For driving, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this online carbon footprint calculator&lt;/a&gt;. I selected &amp;ldquo;Car&amp;rdquo;, entered in 1000km and my car&amp;rsquo;s average MPG (38MPG - though I often get 40-45 on longer trips), and the result was &amp;ldquo;0.14 metric tons:  1000 km in a petrol vehicle doing 38 mpg (US).&amp;rdquo; That is, 140 kgCO2/1000 km, which is the same as .14 kgCO2/km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can visualize the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;prep %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(month, activity) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(sum = sum(emissions)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=as.factor(month), y=sum, fill=activity), stat=&amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)+
  #facet_wrap(~activity, scales=&amp;quot;free&amp;quot;)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE))+
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Personal CO2 Emissions from Transportation&amp;quot;,
       caption = &amp;quot;kgC02/km for flights calculated based on liberal WRI estimate: km * .18. \nkgCO2/km for car calculated based on .14kg per 1000km&amp;quot;,
       x = &amp;quot;Month&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;kgCO2&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://anthonyschmidt.netlify.com/post/2020-02-10-carbon-footprint-google-data/personal-emissions.png&#34; alt=&#34;My Personal Emissions - 2019&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a just a simple example of what one can do with their location data. I will be using my data in an interactive Tableau dashboard that also includes utility usage and will allow me to drill down by month, day, and hour. It will also allow me to compare my 2020 emissions to 2019. &lt;strong&gt;My goal is to have lower emissions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are a lot of possibilities with Google Location data (for tracking carbon emissions, for making cool visualizations), and even with liberal estimates of kgCO2, you still get a sense of your impact and have a visual goal you can compare against for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speaking of Data</title>
      <link>/post/2019-08-24-speaking-of-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2019-08-24-speaking-of-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read this aloud: “We need more data.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you pronounce the word “data”? Was the “da” in data pronounced like day or was the “a” in “da” pronounced with the same “a” as in apple? In other words, do you say day-tuh (IPA: /deɪtə/) or dah-tuh (IPA: /dætə/; like the “a” in “apple”)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things got me thinking about this. First, there was a brief &lt;a href=&#34;https://boingboing.net/2019/08/14/brent-spiner-explains-how-patr.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeqTMTOxid8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that popped up on Twitter arguing that the creation of the character “Data” from Star Trek shifted the pronunciation of the word from /dætə/ to /deɪtə/. I’m not sure I believe this, but it did make me wonder when and why the schism or shift occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, my new role as data visualization researcher had me thinking about how exactly I pronounce my title. Unconsciously, I default to /dætə/. However, when I begin to think about the word and say examples aloud, it seems my pronunciation vacillates between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have no doubt that both pronunciations are “correct” and common, I did wonder which one was more common. I formulated several hypotheses and then developed a method to attempt to test them. I don’t claim that any of this is scientific, but it was really fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HYPOTHESES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that I straddle the line between Gen Xer and Millennial, it is likely my pronunciation of data as /dætə/ is more common. This is just the phenomenon that occurs with my and the next generation. Therefore, younger people will be more likely to say /dætə/.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/dætə/ or perhaps /da:tə/ will be more common in British English than /deɪtə/, which will be more common in American English.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to devise a way to quickly listen to “data” in context across a variety of accents, genders, and ages. I decided to use three sources: Youglish, PlayPhrase, and the TED Corpus of Spoken English (TCSE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youglish.com/search/data/all?&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Youglish&lt;/a&gt; allows you to search YouTube for a word or phrase and then listen to the phrase in context from many different videos, including online lectures, webinars, TED Talks, etc. What’s more, it allows you to filter the videos by accent: US, UK, or Australian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://playphrase.me/#/search?q=data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PlayPhrase&lt;/a&gt; is similar to Youglish. However, rather than utilize YouTube, PlayPhrase mines popular TV shows (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt;) and movies (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://yohasebe.com/tcse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TCSE&lt;/a&gt; is also similar to the websites above. It utilizes only TED Talks (which also appear on Youglish).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first used Youglish, listening to around 20 examples of “data” in US, UK, and Australian English. I then listened to about 20 clips each from PlayPhrase and TCSE (being careful not to repeat TED Talks). In total, I had 100 observations of “data” in context. As I listened, I coded the pronunciation as 1 = /deɪtə/ and 2 = /dætə/; M for male and F for female; US, UK, AUS, or L2 for the accent; and &lt;40 or &gt;40 for a general (and very unscientific) guess about the age of the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to accents, while I recognize there is great variation among the accent categories, the accent codes are generalizations. A US accent represents anyone with a general North American accent. A UK accent represents any of the varieties of British pronunciation. AUS was used only for Youglish videos marked as Australian. Finally, L2 was used for speakers who were not from Anglophone countries (US, UK, IR, AU, NZ) and whose first language was likely not English (based solely on accent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINDINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My findings were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to &lt;strong&gt;hypothesis 1&lt;/strong&gt;, that /dætə/ is more common, I was completely wrong (see Figure 1) . Across all accents, genders, and ages, /deɪtə/ is actually more common. This really surprised me. Even among those older than 40, including the elderly, /deɪtə/ was used common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to &lt;strong&gt;hypothesis 2&lt;/strong&gt;, I was even more wrong (see Figure 2). Those with British accents used /deɪtə/ rather than the other varieties. The only two accents where I heard /dætə/ was the US / North American accent and the Australian accent. For the US / North American accent, /dætə/ was used only 33% of the time; in other words, /deɪtə/ is more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While underrepresented in the sample (18 videos), it is important to note that /dæ tə/ seems most common in the Australian accent (44%). This is very surprising to me because of the close relationship between British and Australian English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.anthonyschmidt.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Overall@2x-100.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.anthonyschmidt.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Accent-and-Gender@2x-100-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIMITATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is not a scientific study. The sample is small, does not represent accents equally, and is sampled online from online videos. However, it does give a general idea of what is the more common pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this was a fun exercise. I learned that my speech pattern of “data” as /dætə/ is not in line with other aspects of my speech that are more common: singular they, singular data, so, like, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have a better idea of which pronunciation is more common, I still have no idea about the history of the word, when the shift occurred, and what facilitated it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cost of International Education</title>
      <link>/post/2019-5-10-the-cost-of-international-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2019-5-10-the-cost-of-international-education/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been thinking about the environmental impact of international education. Given that students travel across the world to study, the CO2 emissions generated from their initial trip, perhaps eventual return, and any trips in between, cannot be ignored.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/008.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;According to the IPCC&lt;/a&gt;, aviation contributes about 3.5% to climate change, only set to increase in the future. The exact impact is difficult to ascertain, as it is hard to separate aviation from other anthropogenic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to judge the per passenger, per kilometer CO2 emissions, as routes and planes vary.  However, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Carbon Footprint website offers a calculator&lt;/a&gt;. Since China is the number one country of origin for international students in the United States, example calculations for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Leading-Host-Institutions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;leading enrollers of international students in the US&lt;/a&gt; could be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 10pt;&#34;&gt;(on American Airlines)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emissions&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 10pt;&#34;&gt;(in metric tons of CO2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New York University&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PEK -&amp;gt; DFW -&amp;gt; JFK&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;1.88&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PEK -&amp;gt; LAX&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;1.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Northeastern University&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PEK -&amp;gt; DFW -&amp;gt; BOS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;1.92&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Columbia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PEK -&amp;gt; DFW -&amp;gt; JFK&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;1.88&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PEK -&amp;gt; DFW -&amp;gt;  PHX&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;1.76&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Again, keep in mind that these will vary based on originating city/country, destination, and connections. The further away or the more connections, the higher the emissions will be.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Averaging the emissions together, that is 1.77 metric tons of CO2 per student just to enter the university. According to IIE, these universities enroll a total of 76,606 international students. There is no public data easily accessible to find out how many Chinese students they enroll, but since China &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iie.org/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Places-of-Origin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;accounts for 33% of international student enrollment&lt;/a&gt;, let’s guesstimate and say 25,280 students. That makes for about 44,746 metric tons of CO2 to attend university. That seems like a really big impact. You can enter that number into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International students are just one example. Other examples include study abroad participants, and even attendance at international (and domestic) conferences (see also here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am in no way making the argument that international students should not enroll and attend universities in the States (or elsewhere).&lt;/strong&gt; Rather, I am wondering if there are any practical solutions that can be thought of to offset their impact. Specifically, I am wondering if it would be feasible to capture a small percentage of their often enormous tuition payments and use that to either purchase carbon offsets or invest in campus sustainability projects. The rest of this blog post will consider the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of carbon offset companies on the internet. These companies use money from purchased offsets to fund different projects. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sustainabletravel.org/utilities/how-is-my-contribution-used-to-offset-my-carbon-emissions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sustainable Travel International&lt;/a&gt; lists three ways their offsets work: “international conservation carbon reforestation projects; renewable energy projects in the United States, or international renewable energy and energy efficiency projects”.  There has been some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/16/carbon-offset-projects-carbon-emissions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; of carbon offsets, with some suggesting they are akin to the indulgences of medieval Europe. In other words, they make people feel good about their impact without truly offsetting carbon emissions; rather, they allow “governments and companies in rich countries to offset their emissions through projects in developing countries (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/08/31/withdrawn-un-advert-shows-carbon-offset-scheme-scrapped/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Climate Change News&lt;/a&gt;). This is often through reforestation once a forest has been cut down.  Yet, some offsets do fund renewable energy initiatives or methane capture projects. And, there is some evidence that carbon offsets might work. An article in &lt;a href=&#34;https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fee.1515&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at a small offset program in California and concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offsets can contribute to climate‐change mitigation, but they can also hinder it if they distract from necessary emissions reductions overall or decrease the feasibility of deep decarbonization. We show that California’s forest offsets – by design – account for a small percentage of emissions reductions but simultaneously provide an important opportunity to supply meaningful carbon sequestration and multiple co‐benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is important to recognize that offsets are not a true solution but rather a temporary one. If carbon offsets only focus on deforestation and reforestation without actually decreasing emissions, they seem rather pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, with their limitations in mind, carbon offsets may be one way to reduce the impact of international education to some extent. How financially feasible is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sustainabletravel.org/utilities/carbon-calculator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sustainable Travel International’s carbon calculator&lt;/a&gt; told me that my trip from Beijing to Boston would be 2.7 metric tons and cost around $65 to offset. In terms of out-of-state tuition that international students pay (for example, the average undergraduate international student pays $30,792 [calculated from IPEDS] at a public masters or doctoral university), the cost of a carbon offset like above is just 0.2% of the tuition. Even rounding up to a $100 offset to account for students who travel further or from places that require more connections amounts to 0.3% of the tuition to offset that student’s carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think any university administrator would think that is a reasonable amount of money to spend since they are already getting enormous revenue from the higher out-of-state tuition markup. Such offsets can also be captured for study abroad participants’ tuition, and since universities already carefully keep track of travel, it could easily be done for personnel travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would they want to do this, especially if every penny counts? For one, there is the moral obligation to do what can be done to help halt climate change. But, typically the moral premise is not enough. It may help institutions participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction/hesi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UN’s Higher Education Sustainability Initiative&lt;/a&gt; as well. Having a “green” campus may attract more students or a different type of student. In addition, sustainability could affect future rankings, or current rankings in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aashe.org/news/aashe-releases-the-2018-sustainable-campus-index/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sustainable campus index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, for little money, there could be a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this comes with a number of caveats. First, is that it is important to recognize the limits of carbon offsets (as mentioned above). It may be more beneficial to use the same 0.3% of tuition to help further fund campus-based sustainability projects that mitigate climate change. In fact, it is likely that some institutions already use tuition to fund such projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, individual universities calculating and purchasing carbon offsets may be a moot point as &lt;a href=&#34;https://thepointsguy.com/guide/a-guide-to-airline-carbon-offset-programs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more airlines already include offsets in their charges&lt;/a&gt;. This might increase in the future as more countries participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation&lt;/a&gt; (CORSIA; see also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/airline-emissions-carbon-offsets-travel/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop Worrying about Buying Carbon Offsets for your Flights&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to consider the total climate change impact of students, not just their initial trip. Do the students live on-campus or off-campus? Do they walk, bike, take public transportation, or drive to school? I could not find any statistics or information that tell me the habits of most international students. But, let’s take NYU as an example, which enrolls the most international students in the US. It is likely that international students who attend NYU will not drive, as traffic is terrible and public transportation is well-developed for New York City. In addition, it is likely they will not be able to afford a large space to live in, which already decreases their energy usage. It may be that, by the end of the academic year, their carbon emissions end up equal to or less than the average student or resident. If the campus promotes green initiatives, the impact might even be lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s important to recognize that international education does play a role in contributing to climate change through aviation emissions. One issue is there is very little research on student impacts (domestic, out-of-state, and international; on-campus, off-campus; though there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uvm.edu/sustain/sites/uvm.edu.sustain/files/uploads/Documents%20Archive/For_Website/Documents_for_Website/Publication%20and%20Resources/ghg_tracking_at_colleges_in_us.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some research on campus impacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sustainability.mit.edu/ghginventory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;solutions&lt;/a&gt;). One solution proposed is to capture a small percentage of extant student tuition and reallocate that for either carbon offsetting or other sustainability projects. Given the cost of offsetting, this can be done without passing any additional cost to students. For other projects, it is likely they are already being funded through tuition, and these funds could certainly be increased given the pressing issue of climate change, again with no additional cost to the student. &lt;strong&gt;If we deem both international education and the environment important, then we must find some way to reconcile the impact while mitigating further climate change&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Data Is/Are In</title>
      <link>/post/2019-02-26-2019-the-data-is-are-in/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2019-02-26-2019-the-data-is-are-in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, it has come to my attention that I use data as a singular noun, as in “The data is nominal” rather than the plural Latinate form that it technically is, as in “The data are nominal.” To those who brought it to my attention, it is a simple mistake. Fix it. Move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, hold up. I’m not so sure about that. I do not like my natural language use corrected. I will use singular they in writing. I will use so as an adverbial connector while speaking. And, dammit, I will use data in the singular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this just my youthful rebellious spirit? Am I on the vanguard of language change? Am I right? Are they wrong? The answer, as you can guess is yes and no. Both “data is” and “data are” seem acceptable. Here’s the evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first turned to Twitter with a poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AnthonyTeacher/status/1100064151299411970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;twitter.png&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter Poll&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validation! But, I wanted a more reliable data source, so I began looking at more scientific linguistics tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Google N-Gram Viewer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google N-Gram viewer (see graph below) tells me that, although “data are” is more common, “data is” is also common and has been rapidly increasing in usage in books since the late 1940s. Interestingly, “data are” skyrocketed the 1970s and peaked in the early 1980s (when I was born) and has been in free fall since then. “Data is” hit a small peak around 2000, when I was in college and probably was exposed to more data-based ideas. Similar to “data are,” “data is” has been in decline (I have no guess as to why) and now they are both similar in frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion here is that, although “data are” once reigned supreme and “data is” has climbed slowly in popularity, they have been able to literally meet each other in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ngram.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ngram.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NGram Chart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general search of &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COCA&lt;/a&gt; tells me the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREQUENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;data were&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4830&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, they did not analyze the impact of fees, as all &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were&lt;/b&gt; net of fees&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;data are&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3088&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; sensitive and consumers have a right to decide whether or not they can be&amp;#8230;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;data is&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2069&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#8230;but the resulting &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; complex and messy.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;data was&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1075&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most of the &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;was&lt;/b&gt; culled from studies conducted from the mid-1990s forward at sites in Illinois, Indiana&amp;#8230;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing the prompted me to do this research was the use of “data is/are” in academic contexts, so a little more searching in COCA revealed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Data is” is 3.8 times more common in academic texts than other genres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Data are” is is 16.8 times more common in academic texts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Data were” is 88.9 times more common in academic texts. In fact, this phrase was quite rare in other genres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Data was” is 10.8 times more common.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion from COCA is similar to the conclusion from Google’s N-Gram viewer: “data are” is more common, especially in academic texts, but “data is” is also common, even in academic texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Corpora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you visited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BYU corpus page&lt;/a&gt; lately? A few years ago, it was dominated by COCA and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BNC&lt;/a&gt;, but it has grown quite a bit since then and we have our choice of corpora ranging from &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/now/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;News on the Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/wiki/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/tv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/movies/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Movie&lt;/a&gt; corpora. I chose three to do a quick comparison of “data are/is”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;data are/were&amp;#8221; Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;data is/was&amp;#8221; Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/glowbe/&#34;&gt;GloWbe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32 / 24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;654 / 206&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/tv/&#34;&gt;TV Corpus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16 / 12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;327 / 103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://corpus.byu.edu/now/&#34;&gt;News on the Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11,728 / 4,594&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;83,123 /18,782&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this data suggests is that “data is” may have grown in tandem with growth in the media, especially online media. This is evident from the higher frequency in the more informal corpora above and the peaks around the year 2000. This growth likely bled over into academic usage as more people were exposed to or participated in these newer forms of communication. However, it is important to recall that the evidence shows “data” as a singular noun existed prior to that growth, too. The growth in media likely amplified the movement of “data is” into common usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Latinate Cousins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data” is not the only plural word used as singular: agenda, bacteria, criteria, media. These are all technically plural forms but often used in the singular. Here is how they are used (from COCA):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;are / were&amp;#8221; frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;is / was&amp;#8221; frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61 / 34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;736 / 258&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;338 / 156&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;108 / 37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;448 / 457&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;119 / 80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1060 / 376&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1655 / 463&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is their growth from Google N-Gram Viewer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ngram-2.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ngram-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Latinate Growth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Is it a British thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love British English and its quirky grammar and vocabulary, like “government are” rather than the American “government is”. So maybe the “data are/is” thing is a holdover from British English since they do prefer plural forms. Interestingly, looking at the British National Corpus, “data are” and “data is” are almost equally as frequent (491 vs 452, respectively). Looking at just the US and GB dialect forms in the GloWbe Corpus reinforced this. In fact, “data is” was more common than “data are” for all inner-circle and outer-circle English varieties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/varieties.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.anthonyteacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/varieties.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Frequency&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. PLOS One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my last check, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antcorgen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AntCorGen&lt;/a&gt; to generate a corpus of 300 results sections from various peer-reviewed journals that are part of PLOS One and then ran a frequency search for “data are” and “data is”. The results were unsurprising: 72 for “data are” and 69 for “data is”. While “data are” had higher frequency in total, “data is” had greater range (greater representation in more than 1 text rather than frequent use in single text): 40 vs 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Cognitive Linguistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, I have explained “data” in the singular sense as a side effect of media growth. However, I think this is neither a fully accurate nor fully plausible explanation. So, what is another way it can be explained? One way is through a cognitive linguistic understanding of “data”. In other words, how is “data” represented in the mind? Is “data” conceived of as numerous individual numbers or as a singular set of numbers? Is “data” the part or the whole? I’d argue that, since humans tend towards gestalt grouping, when we speak of data, we are not speaking of figures or numbers or even datums. We are, instead, referring to a singular group  or body of information. This mental representation then, when reflected in our lexicogrammar, takes the singular form: “the set is,” “the information is”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched mainly for present and some past tense forms of the be verb. I did not, however, check agreement with other common collocating verbs such as show, indicate, suggest, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My exploration through the data has confirmed my original hunch: both forms are acceptable and “data is” has been growing in popularity, growth which has been concomitant with the growth of the media. Furthermore, as data has become more important in our society, it has naturally taken on a singular cognitive gestalt representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for my own writing? I will continue to use the singular form of data and will proudly point any naysayers to its evidence because the data is in and it clearly shows “data is” is OK!&lt;/p&gt;
