&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities of practice (CoPs) are groups of people who share a common interest and participate in activities that promote learning. Originally face-to-face, the internet has ushered in many new platforms for CoPs. Twitter hashtags act as virtual homes for many. The #TidyTuesday hashtag serves as a community for those interested in data science and visualization. It involves weekly visualization challenges utilizing public datasets and the R programming language. Users contribute graphics and code to share their work and also as opportunities to learn from one another. As the importance of data science grows, the #TidyTuesday CoP is a promising context for the exploration of learning in online communities and of how individuals develop capabilities regarding visualization and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current research represents an exploratory project that examines one year of #TidyTuesday tweets through descriptive and content analyses. It examines who contributes, the content of their tweets, the makeup of their code, and how their code changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data yielded 4,148 tweets by 1,231 unique users, 27% of whom contributed more than twice. Mean contribution was nine tweets per user and 5% contributed consistently. Only six consistent contributors appear in the list of the top-25 most popular users (by likes/retweets), meaning consistency may not represent the quality or popularity of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the types of content users contribute, a small sample of tweets was qualitatively analyzed, finding 58% of tweets explained visualizations, 18% focused on findings in the datan, and 13% expressed emotion related to learning. An analysis of Github code contributions classified code into one of nine data science functions. The results showed that most code (41.19%) represented data wrangling, followed by visualization (33.88%). Analyses also indicated that over time individuals wrote longer, more complex code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This preliminary research has education-related implications for those involved in data science. It suggests visualization requires strong programming skills, especially data wrangling; participation in the CoP can lead to an increase in these skills. We will discuss future directions for this work in light of scholarship on informal and social media-based contexts for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
