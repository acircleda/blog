      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Fly or Die&amp;rdquo; project is a multi-survey research project that looks at the complex relationship between graduate student conference travel, employability, and the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey One&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on doctoral student employment outcomes, conferences attendance, conference activities, conference types, and publications. Analyses are across disciplines and job industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey Two&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on tenure-track faculty search comittees and their attitudes toward recently-graduated PhD students&amp;rsquo; conference attendance, conference activities, and publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ulitmate goal of this research is to understand the ideal conference and publication record that can maximize employment outcomes while minimizing our carbon footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
